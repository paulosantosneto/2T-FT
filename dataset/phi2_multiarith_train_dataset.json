With the advancement of smartphones and digital cameras, taking pictures has become more accessible and convenient. This has also allowed people to share their experiences with others through social media platforms.\n\nMoreover, the ability to delete unwanted pictures has given people more control over their digital footprint. It allows them to curate their online presence and only share the pictures that they want others to see. This can also help protect their privacy and prevent any potential embarrassment or harm.\n\nNegative Side:\nOn the other hand, the constant need to take and delete pictures can also have negative effects on individuals. It can create a sense of pressure to always capture the perfect moment and share it with others. This can lead to a decrease in being present in the moment and enjoying experiences without the distraction of taking pictures.\n\nAdditionally, the ease of deleting pictures can also lead to a lack of accountability for one's",

They have a budget of $50 and want to buy chips, soda, and candy. Chips cost $2 per bag, soda costs $1 per can, and candy costs $0.50 per piece. How many bags of chips, cans of soda, and pieces of candy can they buy? \n\nExercise 1: \n\nA store has 24 pencils.

We know that he has 3 new cards and 9 old cards, so he would need a total of 12 cards. Since each page can hold 3 cards, he would need 4 pages to organize all of his cards.\n\nFollow-up Question 1: If Luke's binder can hold a maximum of 20 cards, how many more cards can he add before he needs to buy a new binder?\nAnswer 1: Luke can add 8 more cards before he needs to buy a new binder. Since he already has 12 cards, he can add 8 more before reaching the maximum capacity of 20 cards.\n\nFollow-up Question 2: If Luke's binder can hold a maximum of 20 cards, but he wants to add 5 more cards, how many pages would he need to use?\nAnswer 2: Luke would need to use 2 pages to add 5 more cards. Since each page can hold 3 cards, he would need 2 pages to hold the 5 additional cards.\n\nFollow-up Question 3: If Luke's binder can hold a maximum of 20 cards, but he wants to add 5 more cards, how many pages would he need to use if he decides to add the cards in a different order?\nAnswer 3: Luke would still need to use 2 pages to add 5 more cards, regardless of the order in which he adds them. The number of pages needed is determined",
