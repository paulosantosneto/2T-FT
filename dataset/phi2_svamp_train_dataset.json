We can write this as an equation:\n\nAmount before spending + Amount spent - Amount received = Amount now\n\nWe know the amount now is $ 7, the amount spent is $ 17, and the amount received is $ 10.

This means that there is an error in the question or the answer choices. The correct answer should be $ 27, which is the amount Edward had before he spent his money. We can check this by plugging it into the equation and verifying that it is true:\n\n$ 27 + $ 17 - $ 10 = $ 7\n$ 54 - $ 10 = $ 7\n$ 44 = $ 7\n\nThis is false, so we know that $ 27 is the correct answer.\n\n\n",

Let x be the number of hours Ryan spends on learning chinese. Then, the number of hours he spends on learning english is x + 2, since he spends 2 hours more on english than on chinese. The total number of hours he spends on learning both languages is 5, so we can write an equation:\n\nx + (x + 2) = 5\n\nTo solve for x, we can simplify and isolate x on one side of the equation:\n\n2x + 2 = 5\n2x = 5 - 2\n2x = 3\nx = 3 / 2\nx = 1.5\n\nTherefore, Ryan spends 1.5 hours on learning chinese. To find the number of hours he spends on learning english, we can plug in x = 1.5 into the expression x + 2:\n\nx + 2 = 1.5 + 2\nx + 2 = 3.5\n\nTherefore, Ryan spends 3.5 hours on learning english.\n\n\n",

Then, the number of hours he spends on learning english is x + 2. The total number of hours he spends on learning is 5. So, we can write an equation as follows:\n\nx + (x + 2) = 5\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n2x + 2 = 5\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides, we get:\n\n2x = 3\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\nx = 3/2\n\nThis means Ryan spends 3/2 hours on learning chinese. To find the number of hours he spends on learning english, we can plug in x = 3/2 into the expression x + 2. We get:\n\nx + 2 = 3/2 + 2\n\nx + 2 = 7/2\n\nThis means Ryan spends 7/2 hours on learning english. To write this answer in mixed fraction form, we can divide 7 by 2 and get 3 as the quotient and 1 as the remainder.

Subtraction means taking away some amount from another amount. For example, if you have 10 apples and you eat 3 of them, you are subtracting 3 from 10 and you have 7 apples left.\n\nWe can use the symbol - to represent subtraction. For example, 10 - 3 = 7 means 10 minus 3 equals 7.\n\n## Subtopic: How to solve word problems involving subtraction?\n\nSometimes, we encounter word problems that involve subtraction. These problems require us to use subtraction to find the missing or unknown quantity in a situation. For example, if you have a certain amount of money and you spend some of it, you need to subtract the amount you spent from the amount you had to find out how much money you have left.\n\nTo solve word problems involving subtraction, we need to follow these steps:\n\n- Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the question.\n- Choose a variable, such as x, y, or z, to represent the unknown quantity.\n- Write an equation that relates the variable and the given information using subtraction.\n- Solve the equation for the variable by using inverse operations, such as adding,",

Therefore, we can set up the equation x + (163 - 89) * 98 = 16,062. Simplifying this equation, we get x + 74 * 98 = 16,062. Multiplying 74 by 98, we get x + 7,128 = 16,062. Subtracting 7,128 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 16,062 - 7,128 = 8,874. Therefore, the Razorback t-shirt shop made $8,874 from selling t-shirts during the Arkansas game.\n",

So, we can write:\n\nDistance of mouse = Distance of frog + 15\n\nWe can substitute this expression into the formula and get:\n\nTotal distance = 36 + (Distance of frog + 15) + (Distance of frog + 15)\n\nWe can simplify this by combining the like terms:\n\nTotal distance = 36 + 2 * (Distance of frog + 15)\n\nWe can distribute the 2 and get:\n\nTotal distance = 36 + 2 * Distance of frog + 30\n\nWe can subtract 36 from both sides and get:\n\n2 * Distance of frog = 6\n\nWe can divide both sides by 2 and get:\n\nDistance of frog = 3\n\nTherefore, the frog jumped 3 inches more than the grasshopper, which is 36 + 3 = 39 inches.\n\nHence, the frog jumped 39 inches.\n\n\n",

To do this, we can multiply the number of hours he spends on learning each day by the number of days he learns.

One way to do this is to use the elimination method.

For example, we can solve for x in terms of y from the first equation:\n\nx + y = 10\nx = 10 - y\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for x in the second equation and solve for y:\n\n86x + 86y = ?\n86(10 - y) + 86y = ?\n860 - 86y + 86y = ?\n860 = ?\n\nThis means that the value of",

This is called finding the quotient of a division.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n36 \u00f7 18 = ?\n\nTo divide 36 by 18, we can use repeated subtraction. We start with 36 and subtract 18 as many times as possible until we get zero or a remainder.\n\n36 - 18 = 18\n18 - 18 = 0\n\nWe subtracted 18 twice, so the quotient is 2. This means that each person ate 2 crackers.\n\nAlternatively, we can use a division symbol and a long division method to find the quotient.\n\nWe write 36 as the dividend and 18 as the divisor. We ask ourselves how many times 18 goes into 36. We can start by dividing 36 by 18 and writing the quotient above the dividend.\n\n18 | 36\n\nWe multiply 18 by the quotient and write the product below 36. We subtract the product from 36 and write the difference below.\n\n18 | 36\n",

For example, if we add 3 and 4, we get 7. We can write this as 3 + 4 = 7. The numbers that are added are called addends, and the result is called the sum.\n\nSubtopic 2: How to add numbers?\n\nTo add numbers, we can use different methods, such as counting on, using a number line, or using place value. Here are some examples of each method:\n\n- Counting on: We start with the larger number and count up by the smaller number. For example, to add 5 and 3, we can start with 5 and count up 3 more: 5, 6, 7, 8. The sum is 8.\n- Using a number line: We draw a line and mark the numbers on it. Then we move from one number to the next by jumping the same distance as the other number.",

He sells a total of 120 pens and pencils and earns Rs. 1440. How many pens and pencils did he sell?\n\nA: Let x be the number of pens and y be the number of pencils. Then we have two equations:\n\nx + y = 120 (1)\n\n12x + 8y = 1440 (2)\n\nWe can solve this system of equations by using the method of elimination. We multiply equation (1) by 8 and subtract it from equation (2) to eliminate y:\n\n12x + 8y = 1440\n\n-8x - 8y = -960\n\n4x = 360\n\nx = 90\n\nThen we substitute x = 90 into equation (1) to find y:\n\n90 + y = 120\n\ny = 30\n\nTherefore, the shopkeeper sold 90 pens and 30 pencils.\n",

We know that x + y = 184 (since they sold a total of 184 items) and 62x + 99y = total money made. We can use substitution to solve for x. Solving for x in the first equation, we get x = 184 - y. Substituting this into the second equation, we get 62(184 - y) + 99y = total money made. Simplifying this equation, we get 11,832 - 62y + 99y = total money made. Combining like terms, we get 37y = 11,832 - total money made. Dividing both sides by 37, we get y = (11,832 - total money made) / 37. Now we can substitute this value of y back into the first equation to solve for x. Substituting y = (11,832 - total money made) / 37 into x + y = 184, we get x + (11,832 - total money made) / 37 = 184. Multiplying both sides by 37, we get 37x + 11,832 - total money made = 6,928. Rearranging the equation, we get 37x = 6,928 - 11,832 + total money made. Simplifying, we get 37x = -3,104 +",

We know that x + y = 158 and 76x + 204y = total revenue. We can use substitution to solve for x. From the first equation, we can solve for y: y = 158 - x. Substituting this into the second equation, we get 76x + 204(158 - x) = total revenue. Simplifying, we get 76x + 32,912 - 204x = total revenue. Combining like terms, we get -128x + 32,912 = total revenue. Dividing both sides by -128, we get x = -254.375. Since we can't sell a fraction of a jersey, we know that x must be a whole number. Therefore, the Razorback shop sold 2 jerseys. To find the total revenue, we can substitute x = 2 into the equation 76x + 204y = total revenue. We get 76(2) + 204y = total revenue. Simplifying, we get 152 + 204y = total revenue. We know that y = 158 - x, so we can substitute this into the equation: 152 + 204(158 - x) = total revenue.

How many boxes of trefoils does she need to deliver if each case has 14 boxes?\n\nSolution 0:\n\nTo find the total number of boxes of trefoils that Shirley needs to deliver, we can use the following steps:\n\n- First, we need to find the number of boxes in one case. Since each case has 14 boxes, we can write this as 14.\n- Next, we need to find the number of cases that Shirley sold. Since she sold 25 cases, we can write this as 25.\n- Finally, we need to multiply the number of boxes in one case by the number of cases that Shirley sold. This will give us the total number of boxes of trefoils that she needs to deliver. We can write this as 14 x 25.\n- To simplify this expression, we can use the distributive property of multiplication. This means that we can multiply 14 by each term inside the parentheses and then add the results. We can write this as 14 x 25 = (14 x 20) + (14 x 5).\n- To multiply 14 by 20, we can use the standard algorithm of multiplication. We can write this as:\n\n  14\nx 20\n----\n  280\n\n- To multiply 14 by 5, we can use the same algorithm. We can write this as:\n\n  14\nx  5\n----\n  70",

She wants to have 12 nintendo games left after giving away some of her sony games. How many nintendo games does she need to give away?\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use a simple equation. Let's say x represents the number of nintendo games Kelly needs to give away. Then, we can write the equation as:\n\n20 - x = 12\n\nTo find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 20 from both sides:\n\n-x = 12 - 20\n\n-x = -8\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative sign:\n\nx = 8\n\nTherefore, Kelly needs to give away 8 nintendo games to have 12 nintendo games left.\n\nLogical Reasoning Exercises:\n\n1. If Kelly has 30 nintendo games and wants to have 15 nintendo games left, how many nintendo games does she need to give away?\nAnswer: 15\n\n2. If Kelly has 50 sony games and",

For example, 36 / 12 = 3 means 36 divided by 12 is equal to 3.\n\nSo, to find the number of flower beds, we can write:\n\n36 / 12 = 3\n\nThis means they had 3 flower beds.\n\nBut we are not done yet. We need to check if this answer makes sense. We know that they planted 36 seeds and each flower bed had 12 seeds.

She has 10 boxes of trefoils and needs to deliver them to 5 different places. How many boxes will she have in each place?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use a special math tool called division. Division is when we split a big number into smaller groups. In this case, we want to split 10 boxes into 5 groups.\n\nFirst, we need to write the problem in a special way. We write it like this: 10 \u00f7 5 = ?. The symbol \u00f7 means \"divided by\". The number on the left side is called the dividend, which is the big number we want to split. The number on the right side is called the divisor, which is the number we are dividing by. The question mark (?) is where we need to find the answer.\n\nNow, let's solve the problem step by step. We start by dividing the first box into 5 groups. We can do this by counting 5 boxes at a time. After counting 5 boxes, we have 1 box left. We write this as 1 \u00f7 5 = ?.\n\nNext, we divide the second box into 5 groups. We can do this by counting 5 boxes at a time again. After counting 5 boxes, we have 0 boxes",

How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?\n\nSolution 0:\n\nTo find the difference in price between a t-shirt and a jersey, we need to subtract the cost of a jersey from the cost of a t-shirt. We can use the given information to write an equation:\n\nCost of t-shirts = Cost of t-shirts per unit x Number of t-shirts sold\nCost of jerseys = Cost of jerseys per unit x Number of jerseys sold\n\nWe know that the cost of a t-shirt is $ 240 and the cost of a jersey is $ 210. We also know that the number of t-shirts sold is 177 and the number of jerseys sold is 23. Substituting these values into the equations, we get:\n\nCost of t-shirts = $ 240 x 177\nCost of jerseys = $ 210 x 23\n\nTo simplify these expressions, we can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition. This means that we can multiply each term inside the parentheses by the factor outside the parentheses. For example:\n\n$ 240 x 177 = (200 + 40) x 177\n= 200 x 177 + 40 x 177\n\nUsing the same method, we can simplify the other expression:\n\n$ 210 x 23",

How much more does a t-shirt cost than a jersey?\n\nSolution:\nLet's assume the cost of a jersey is x dollars.\nThe cost of a t-shirt is $ 240 more than the cost of a jersey, so it is x + $ 240.\nThe total revenue from selling jerseys is 23 * $ 210 = $ 4970.\nThe total revenue from selling t-shirts is 177 * (x + $ 240) = 177x + $ 4020.\nThe total revenue from selling both jerseys and t-shirts is $ 4970 + (177x + $ 4020) = $ 8970 + 177x.\nSince the total revenue is the sum of the revenue from selling jerseys and t-shirts, we can set up the equation:\n$ 8970 + 177x = 177x + $ 4020\nSubtracting 177x from both sides of the equation, we get:\n$ 8970 = $ 4020\nThis equation is not possible, which means there is an error in the problem statement or the given information.\n",

We get:\n\n466 x 53 + 466 x 181 = 24,938 + 82,946\n\n= 107,832\n\nTherefore, there are 107,832 flowers and sticks in all.\n\nSubtopic 3: How to use the distributive property to simplify expressions?\n\nSometimes, we may encounter expressions that have parentheses and multiplication. We can use the distributive property to simplify these expressions by removing the parentheses and multiplying each term by the factor outside. For example, consider the expression:\n\n(2x + 3) x 4\n\nWe can use the distributive property to rewrite this expression as:\n\n2x x 4 + 3 x 4\n\n= 8x + 12\n\nThis is equivalent to the original expression, but it is simpler and easier to work with.\n\nSubtopic 4: How to use the distributive property to solve equations?\n\nWe can also use the distributive property to solve equations that involve multiplication and addition or subtraction. For example, consider the equation:\n\n3(x + 2) = 15\n\nWe can use the distributive property to expand the left side of the equation and",

We can do this by subtracting the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on the current day.\n\nNumber of visitors on the first day = 557 - 188 = 369\n\nNext, we need to find the number of visitors on the second day. We can do this by subtracting the number of visitors on the first day from the number of visitors on the current day.\n\nNumber of visitors on the second day = 557 - 369 = 188\n\nWe can see that the number of visitors on each day is the same as the number of visitors on the previous day. This means that the number of visitors on each day is a constant. We can use this constant to find the number of visitors on any day within 57 days.\n\nFor example, to find the number of visitors on the third day, we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of visitors on the third day = Number of visitors on the first day + Number of visitors on the second day\n\nNumber of visitors on the third day = 369 + 188 = 557\n\nSimilarly, to find the number of visitors on the fourth day, we can use the same formula:\n\nNumber of visitors on the fourth day = Number of visitors on the",

There, Rachel learned that 557 visitors came to the Buckingham palace that day. If there were 188 visitors the previous day.

We can use the following formula:\n\nTotal number of visitors = Number of visitors on the first day + Number of visitors on the second day + ... + Number of visitors on the 57th day\n\nWe are given the number of visitors on the first day and the second day, so we can plug them into the formula:\n\nTotal number of visitors = 188 + 557\n\nWe can use the commutative property of addition to rearrange the order of the terms:\n\nTotal number of visitors = 557 + 188\n\nWe can use the associative property of addition to group the terms:\n\nTotal number of visitors = (5 + 57) + (1 + 8)\n\nWe can use the distributive property of addition to simplify the parentheses:\n\nTotal number of visitors = 5 + 57 + 1 + 8\n\nWe can use the commutative property of addition again to rearrange the order of the terms:\n\nTotal number of visitors = 1 + 5 + 57 + 8\n\nWe can use the",

We can use the following formula:\n\nDifference = Number of action figures - Number of books\n\nWe know that Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures on the shelf, so we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDifference = 4 - 3\n\nWe can simplify this expression by subtracting 3 from 4:\n\nDifference = 1\n\nThis means that Jerry had 1 more action figure than book on the shelf. However, the question asks for the difference between the number of action figures and books, not the number of action figures more than books. To find the difference, we need to subtract the number of books from the number of action figures, not the other way around.

We can do this by subtracting the number of sweet cookies that he had from the number of sweet cookies that he ate. This gives us:\n\n37 - 5 = 32\n\n- Next, we need to find the number of salty cookies that Paco ate. We can do this by subtracting the number of salty cookies that he had from the number of salty cookies that he ate.

We can use the following steps:\n\n- First, we need to find the total number of birds and storks that came to join them. To do this, we can add the number of birds and the number of storks that were already sitting on the fence. This gives us:\n\n6 + 2 = 8\n\n- Next, we need to find the total number of birds and storks that are sitting on the fence. To do this, we can add the number of birds and the number of storks that came to join them. This gives us:\n\n8 + 3 = 11\n\n- Finally, we need to find the difference between the number of storks and birds that are sitting on the fence. To do this, we can subtract the number of birds from the number of storks. This gives us:\n\n3 - 8 = -5\n\n- However, this answer does not make sense, because we cannot have a negative number of birds or storks. This means that we have made a mistake somewhere in our calculations. The mistake is that we have added the number of birds and the number of storks that were already sitting on the fence, instead of subtracting them. This gives us:\n\n6 + 2 = 8\n",

In this case, the larger number is the number of bottle caps that Danny found, which is 50. The smaller number is the number of wrappers that Danny found, which is 46.\n- Step 2: Subtract the smaller number from the larger number. This gives us the difference between the two numbers. We can use a number line, a calculator, or mental math to do this. For example, using a calculator, we get:\n\n50 - 46 = 4\n\n- Step 3: Write the answer in a sentence. This tells us how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny found at the park. We can use the word \"than\" to compare the two numbers.

Subtraction is the operation of finding the difference between two numbers. For example, if we have 10 apples and we eat 3, then we have 10 - 3 = 7 apples left.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the number of children who were riding on the bus at the start and the number of children who got on and off the bus. We need to find the difference between these two numbers, which will tell us how many more children got off the bus than those that got on.\n\nWe can use the following formula to find the difference between two numbers:\n\nDifference = First number - Second number\n\nIn this case, the first number is the number of children who were riding on the bus at the start, which is 23. The second number is the number of children who got on the bus, which is 24. So, we can plug these values into the formula and get:\n\nDifference = 23 - 24\n\nTo subtract 24 from 23, we need to borrow 1 from the tens place and add 10 to the ones place. This gives us:\n\nDifference = (23 - 24) + 10\n\nNow, we can subtract 24 from 23 in the ones place and get:\n\nDifference = (23 - 24) + 10\n= (-1) + 10\n= 9\n",

This gives us the number of children who got off the bus more than those who got on. We can use the subtraction property of equality to write this as:\n\n23-24 = -1\n\nThis means that there were -1 children who got off the bus more than those who got on. This is not possible, so we can say that there were no children who got off the bus more than those who got on.

We can do this by adding the number of salty and sweet cookies that he ate.\n- Next, we need to find the number of sweet cookies that Paco ate. We can do this by subtracting the number of sweet cookies that he ate from the total number of cookies that he ate.\n- Finally, we need to find the number of salty cookies that Paco ate. We can do this by subtracting the number of salty cookies that he ate from the total number of cookies that he ate.\n\nUsing these steps, we can calculate the difference as follows:\n\n- Total number of cookies that Paco ate = 28 + 15 = 43\n- Number of sweet cookies that Paco ate = 43 - 15 = 28\n- Number of salty cookies that Paco ate = 43 - 28 = 15\n\nTherefore, the difference between",

Subtraction is a way of finding the difference between two numbers. The number we start with is called the minuend, and the number we take away is called the subtrahend. The result is called the difference.\n\nIn this problem, the minuend is 32, the subtrahend is the number of pieces of candy Bobby ate, and the difference is 20. We can write this as:\n\n32 - subtrahend = 20\n\nTo find the subtrahend, we can use the inverse operation of subtraction, which is addition. Addition is a way of combining two or more numbers to get a bigger number. The number we add is called the addend, and the result is called the sum.\n\nIn this problem, we want to find the subtrahend, so we need to add the difference to the minuend. We can write this as:\n\nsubtrahend + 20 = 32\n\nTo isolate the subtrahend, we need to undo the addition by subtract",

We are given that 41 sacks of unripe oranges and 86 sacks of ripe oranges are harvested per day.\n- Step 2: Compare the quantities of ripe and unripe oranges harvested per day. We can see that 86 is larger than 41, so we can use the larger quantity as the dividend and the smaller quantity as the divisor.\n- Step 3: Perform the subtraction operation. We can use the standard algorithm or mental math to subtract 41 from 86. We get:\n\n  86\n- 41\n----\n  45\n\n- Step 4: Write the answer. The difference between the number of sacks of ripe and unripe oranges harvested per day is 45. We can write this as:\n\n  86 - 41 = 45\n\n- Step 5: Check the answer. We can use estimation or inverse operation to check if our answer is reasonable. We can estimate that 86 is close to 90 and 41 is close to 40, so the difference should be close to 50.

We can use the following steps:\n\n- First, we need to find the total number of sacks of oranges harvested per day. To do this, we need to add the number of sacks of unripe oranges and the number of sacks of ripe oranges. We can use the given information to write an equation:\n\nTotal number of sacks of oranges = 41 + 86\n\n- Next, we need to simplify the equation by adding the numbers. We can use the following rules:\n\n- To add two numbers with the same unit, we can add their units and keep the same unit. For example, 41 + 86 = (40 + 80) + 1 = 120 + 1 = 121\n- To add two numbers with different units, we can convert them to the same unit and then add them. For example, 41 + 86 = (40 + 80) + (1 + 0) = 120 + 1 = 121\n\n- Using these rules, we can simplify the equation as follows:\n\nTotal number of sacks of oranges = 41 + 86\n= (40 + 80) + (1 + 0)\n= 120 + 1\n= 121\n\n- Finally, we need to find the difference between the number of sacks of ripe and unripe oranges.",

We are given that Haley has 23 marbles and she wants to keep 15 marbles for herself. This means that she has 23 - 15 = 8 marbles left to share with the boys.\n- Step 2: Find the number of boys in Haley's class. We can use the fact that Haley has 8 marbles left to share with the boys to find the number of boys. If we assume that each boy gets the same number of marbles, then we can divide the number of marbles left by the number of marbles each boy gets. This gives us 8 / x = number of boys, where x is the number of marbles each boy gets.\n- Step 3: Solve for x. To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by x, which cancels out the x on the left side. This gives us 8 = x * number of boys. Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by the number of boys, which cancels out the number of boys on the right side. This gives us",

This is because the total number of bird families near the mountain is the sum of the bird families that came to live there and the bird families that stayed there. We can write this as an equation:\n\nNumber of bird families near the mountain = Number of bird families that came to live near the mountain from the arctic + Number of bird families that stayed near the mountain\n\nWe know that the number of bird families that came to live near the mountain from the arctic is 24, and the number of bird families that flew away for winter is 59.

If 406 people visited the Buckingham palace within the past 327 days, then the average number of visitors per day is 406/327 = 1.23. Therefore, the number of visitors on the previous day is 1.23 - 132 = -120.23. This means that 120.23 fewer visitors came to the Buckingham palace on the previous day than on the current day. However, this is not a realistic answer, since the number of visitors cannot be negative. Therefore, we have to round this answer to the nearest whole number, which is 120.

This will give us the number of crackers he gave to his friends.\n- Second, we need to divide the number of crackers he gave to his friends by the number of friends he shared with. This will give us the number of crackers each friend got.\n\nLet's do the calculations:\n\n- Matthew had 15 crackers and kept 10 crackers. So, he gave 15 - 10 = 5 crackers to his friends.\n- Matthew shared with 5 friends. So, each friend got 5 / 5 = 1 cracker.\n\nTherefore, each friend got 1 cracker.\n\n\n",

First, we can substitute P = 53 into the equation for D, and get D = 53 + 17 = 70. Then, we can substitute C = 14 into the equation for D, and get D = 14 - 10 = 4. So, David did 70 push-ups and 4 crunches. To find the values of P and C, we can use the equations for D, P, and C. We know that D = P + 17, so we can subtract 17 from both sides, and get D - 17 = P. We also know that D = C - 10, so we can add 10 to both sides, and get D + 10 = C. Now, we can use the values of D and C to find P and C. We know that D = 70, so we can substitute D = 70 into the equation for D - 17, and get 70 - 17 = P. We can simplify this, and get 53 = P. So, Zachary did 53 push-ups. We also know",

If the number of visitors increased by 10% each day, how many visitors would have come to the Buckingham palace in the past 89 days?\nA: To find the total number of visitors, we need to use the formula for compound interest: A = P(1+r)^n, where A is the final amount, P is the initial amount, r is the interest rate, and n is the number of periods.\n\nIn this case, P = 1750, r = 10% = 0.1, and n = 89.\n\nA = 1750(1+0.1)^89 = 1750(1.1)^89 = 1750(2.8) = 4975\n\nTherefore, if the number of visitors increased by 10% each day, 4975 visitors would have come to the Buckingham palace in the past 89 days.\n\n2.

What is the area of the garden?\nAnswer:\nTo find the area of a rectangle, we can multiply its length by its width.\nArea = Length \u00d7 Width\nArea = 10 meters \u00d7 5 meters\nArea = 50 square meters\n\nQuestion 3:\nA recipe calls for 2 cups of flour to make 12 cookies. How many cups of flour are needed to make 36 cookies?\nAnswer:\nTo find the amount of flour needed, we can set up a proportion using the number of cookies and the amount of flour.\n2 cups / 12 cookies = x cups / 36 cookies\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n12x = 2 \u00d7 36\n12x = 72\nDividing both sides by 12, we find:\nx = 6\nTherefore, 6 cups of flour are needed to make 36 cookies.\n\nQuestion 4:\nA store is having a sale where all items are 20% off.

The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour.\nTo find out how many more cups of flour she needs, we subtract the cups of flour she has already put in from the total cups of flour needed.\n9 cups - 0 cups = 9 cups\nSo, Mary needs 9 more cups of flour.\nFinally, we need to find out the difference between the cups of flour and cups of sugar she needs.\n9 cups - 2 cups = 7 cups\nTherefore, Mary needs 7 more cups of flour than cups of sugar.\n",

How much money does he earn each week?\n\nSolution: To find out how much money Lewis earns each week, we need to divide the total amount of money he earns by the number of weeks he works. We can use the following formula:\n\nMoney earned per week = Total money earned / Number of weeks\n\nWe know that Lewis earns $ 460 in 5 weeks. So we can plug these values into the formula and get:\n\nMoney earned per week = $ 460 / 5\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 5. This gives us:\n\nMoney earned per week = $ 92 / 1\n\nThis means that Lewis earns $ 92 every week.\n\n\n",

We can use the distributive property to simplify these expressions by removing the parentheses and multiplying each term by the factor outside the parentheses. For example, to simplify the expression 3(x + 2), we can write 3 as 1 x 3 and multiply each term by 3. We get:\n\n3(x + 2) = 3 x (x + 2)\n= (1 x 3) x x + (1 x 3) x 2\n= 3x + 6\n\nWe can also use the distributive property to factor expressions that have a common factor outside the parentheses. For example, to factor the expression 6x + 12, we can write 6 as 2 x 3 and factor out the common factor of 2. We get",

So, we can write:\n\n315 - 291 = ?\n\nTo subtract, we can start from the rightmost digit and subtract each pair of digits. If the digit on the top is smaller than the digit on the bottom, we can borrow 1 from the next digit to the left and add 10 to the top digit. For example, in the ones place, we have 5 - 1 = 4, and in the tens place, we have 1 - 9 = -8. Since we cannot have a negative digit, we have to borrow 1 from the hundreds place and add 10 to the tens place. So, we have:\n\n1 - 9 = -8\n10 - 8 = 2\n\nWe have to do this for each pair of digits until we reach the leftmost digit. Then, we have:\n\n1 - 3 = -2\n10 - 2 = 8\n\nSo, the difference is 8.

We can also use the equal sign (=) to show that the two sides of the equation are the same.\n\n35 \u00f7 5 = ?\n\nTo divide, we can use repeated subtraction or skip counting.

A negative number means that David did more push-ups than crunches, and a positive number means that Zachary did more crunches than push-ups. In this case, Zachary did 33 more crunches than push-ups, so the answer is 33.\n\n",

To find the number of storks, we need to add the number of storks that were already there and the number of storks that came later. Then we need to subtract the number of storks from the number of birds to get the difference.\n\nNumber of birds = 2 + 5 = 7\nNumber of storks = 4 + 4 = 8\nDifference = 7 - 8 = -1\n\nHowever, the question asks for the number of birds more than storks, not less than or equal to. So we need to change the sign of the difference to positive.\n\nDifference = -1 x -1 = 1\n\nTherefore, there are 1 more bird than stork on the fence.\n",

For example:\n\n  632\n- 410\n-----\n  122\n\nWe can see that the difference is 122. However, the question asks for the difference in terms of the number of girls and boys, not the number of digits. To find the number of girls and boys, we need to add 465 to the number of girls.

How many salty cookies did Paco have left?\n\nSolution: To find out how many salty cookies Paco had left, we need to subtract the number of salty cookies he ate from the number of salty cookies he had at the beginning. We can use the following steps:\n\n- First, we write the number of salty cookies Paco had at the beginning as 26.\n- Next, we write the number of salty cookies Paco ate as 9.\n- Then, we write the subtraction sign (-) between the two numbers.\n- After that, we subtract 9 from 26 by counting backwards from 26 by 9. We can use a number line or our fingers to help us.\n- We start from 26 and count backwards 9 times. We get 17, 8, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5.\n- We stop when we reach -5, which means we have subtracted 9 from 26.\n- Finally, we write the answer as -5. This means Paco had -5 salty cookies left.\n\nHowever, this answer does not make sense, because we cannot have a negative number of cookies. This means we made a mistake somewhere in our subtraction. We need to check our work and find out where we went wrong.",

How many more marbles did he find than those he lost?\n\nA. 1\nB. 2\nC. 3\nD. 4\n\nSolution: The correct option is C. 3\n\nTo find the difference between the number of marbles Josh found and the number of marbles he lost, we can use the following formula:\n\nDifference = Number of marbles found - Number of marbles lost\n\nWe know that Josh found 10 new marbles and lost 8 marbles, so we can plug these values into the formula:\n\nDifference = 10 - 8\n\nDifference = 2\n\nThis means that Josh found 2 more marbles than he lost. However, the question asks for the difference between the number of marbles he found and the number of marbles he lost, not the total difference. To find the total difference, we can use the absolute value function, which gives the positive value of any number. The absolute value of 2 is 2, so the total difference is 2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is C. 3. Josh found 3 more marbles than those he lost.\n\n\n",

We can write this as:\n\n7 - 3 = 4\n\nThis means that 7 apples minus 3 apples equals 4 apples.\n\nSimilarly, we can use subtraction to find the number of bottle caps that Danny had at first. We know that he found 22 bottle caps and 8 wrappers at the park, and now he has 28 bottle caps and 63 wrappers in his collection. We can write this as:\n\n28 - 22 = 6\n63 - 8 = 55\n\nThis means that Danny found 6 more bottle caps and 55 more wrappers than he had at first.

To find the total number of balloons that Allan had, we need to add the number of balloons he had before and the number of balloons he bought at the park. We can use the symbol + to show addition. So, we can write:\n\nAllan's balloons = 5 + 3\n\nWe can also use parentheses to group the numbers that we add. So, we can write:\n\nAllan's balloons = (5 + 3)\n\nNow, we can use the order of operations to simplify the expression inside the parentheses. The order of operations tells us to do the addition first, and then the multiplication. So, we can write:\n\nAllan's balloons = (5 + 3) = 8\n\nTherefore, Allan had 8 balloons in total.\n\n\n",

This is called finding the quotient of a division. We can use the following formula:\n\nNumber of flower beds = Total number of seeds / Number of seeds in each flower bed\n\nIn this case, the total number of seeds is 60 and the number of seeds in each flower bed is 10. So, we can plug these values into the formula and simplify:\n\nNumber of flower beds = 60 / 10\nNumber of flower beds = 6\n\nTherefore, Paige and her mom had 6 flower beds.\n\n\n",

This gives us 8 balloons.\n- Allan bought 2 more balloons at the park. To find the total number of balloons after buying more, we add 2 to 8. This gives us 10 balloons.\n- To find the total number of balloons, we add the number of balloons before and after buying more. This gives us 10 balloons.\n\nTherefore, Allan and Jake had 8 balloons in the park.\n\n\n",

            "reasoning_text": "\n\nSolution 0:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the concept of multiplication and addition. Multiplication is a way of adding the same number repeatedly. For example, 3 x 4 means adding 3 four times, or 3 + 3 + 3 + 3. Addition is a way of combining two or more numbers to get a total. For example, 4 + 3 means adding 4 and 3 to get 7.\n\nWe can use multiplication to find the total number of oranges harvested in a day. We know that they harvest 31 sacks of ripe oranges and 24 sacks of unripe oranges per day. To find the total number of oranges, we need to add the number of ripe oranges and the number of unripe oranges. We can use multiplication to make this easier. We can multiply the number of sacks by the number of oranges in each sack. For example, 31 x 10 means adding 10 31 times, or 10 + 10 + 10 + ... + 10 (31 times). Similarly, 24 x 10 means adding 10 24 times, or 10 + 10 + 10 + ... + 10 (24 times). Then, we can add the two products to get the total number of oranges. For example, 31 x 10 + 24 x 10 = 310 + 240 = 550. This means that they harvest 550 sacks of oranges in a day.\n\nWe can use addition to find the total number of oranges harvested in 45 days.

We can see that the problem is that the harvest rate of unripe oranges is negative, which means that they are harvesting more ripe oranges than unripe oranges. This is not realistic, so we have to assume that the problem is wrong or incomplete. Maybe the harvest rate of unripe oranges is not 24 sacks per day, but 24 sacks per week, or 24/7 sacks per day. Or maybe the harvest rate of ripe oranges is not 31 sacks per day, but 31 sacks per week, or 31/7 sacks per day.
