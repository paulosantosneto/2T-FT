Nancy grew 2 onions, Dan grew 9 onions, and Mike grew 4 onions. \n\nNext, we need to find the total number of onions they grew together. To do this, we add the number of onions each person grew: \n\n2 + 9 + 4 = 15 \n\nSo, they grew a total of 15 onions. \n\nNow, we need to find the total number of days they worked. They worked for 6 days. \n\nTo find the total number of onions they grew in 6 days, we multiply the number of onions they grew together by the number of days they worked: \n\n15 x 6 = 90 \n\nSo, they grew a total of 90 onions in 6 days. \n\nTherefore, they grew a total of 90 onions in 6 days. \n",

For example, we can group the first two terms and the last two terms:\n\n(2 + 9) + 4 = 11 + 4\n\nThen, we can use the commutative property to rearrange the terms:\n\n11 + 4 = 4 + 11\n\nFinally, we can use the identity property to add zero to any term:\n\n4 + 11 = 4 + (11 + 0)\n\nNow, we can use the inverse property to subtract 11 from both sides:\n\n4 + (11 + 0) = 4 + (11 + 0) - 11\n\nThis gives us the final answer:\n\n4 + (11 + 0) = 4\n\nSo, they grew 4 onions in total.\n",

According to the problem, we have the following equation:\n\n0.35 = 0.81 - x\n\nTo solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.81 from both sides:\n\n0.35 - 0.81 = 0.81 - 0.81 - x\n\n-0.46 = -x\n\nNow, we can multiply both sides by -1 to get x by itself:\n\n-0.46 * -1 = -x * -1\n\n0.46 = x\n\nTherefore, it rained 0.46 inches in April.\n",
