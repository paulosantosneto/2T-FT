This is an example of a simple addition problem, where we add two numbers to get a sum. We can use the symbol + to represent addition, and the symbol = to represent equality. For example, 25 + 73 = 98 means that 25 plus 73 is equal to 98. We can also use a number line to visualize addition. A number line is a horizontal line that has numbers marked at equal intervals. To add two numbers, we start from the first number and move to the right by the amount of the second number. For example, to add 25 and 73, we start from 25 and move 73 units to the right. We end up at 98, which is the sum of 25 and 73.\n\n\n",

We can use the symbol + to represent addition. For example, 25 + 73 means adding 25 and 73 together. We can also use a number line to help us visualize addition.

For example, to add 25 and 73, we can start from 25 on the number line and move 73 units to the right. The number where we end up is the sum of 25 and 73. We can also use a place value chart to help us add numbers. A place value chart is a table that shows the value of each digit in a number based on its position. For example, to add 25 and 73, we can write them in a place value chart like this:\n\n| Tens | Ones |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2 | 5 |\n| 7 | 3 |\n\nWe can add the ones column first, which gives us 5 + 3 = 8.

They need to determine the number of buses required to transport all the students. Each bus can accommodate 50 students. By counting by tens, they can easily calculate the number of buses needed.\n\nUse Case 2: Organizing a Book Drive\nA group of students wants to organize a book drive to collect books for a local library. They plan to distribute the books equally among the library's branches. By counting by tens, they can determine the number of books each branch will receive.\n\nUse Case 3: Distributing Party Favors\nA teacher is organizing a class party and wants to distribute party favors to all the students. Each student will receive 10 party favors. By counting by tens, the teacher can easily calculate the total number of party favors needed.\n\nExercise 1: Counting by Tens\nCount by tens from 10 to 100.\nAnswer: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100\n\nExercise 2",

We can use the following formula:\n\nNumber of cupcakes to buy = Total number of cupcakes - Number of cupcakes already have\n\nWe know that the total number of cupcakes Priya needs is 54, and the number of cupcakes she already has is 15 chocolate and 25 vanilla. We can add these numbers to get the total number of cupcakes she already has:\n\nNumber of cupcakes already have = 15 + 25 = 40\n\nNow we can plug these numbers into the formula and simplify:\n\nNumber of cupcakes to buy = 54 - 40\nNumber of cupcakes to buy = 14\n\nTherefore, Priya needs to buy 14 more cupcakes for her party.\n\n\n",

So we can plug these values into the equation and solve for the number of maple trees planted today:\n\n64 = 53 + Number of maple trees planted today\n\nTo isolate the number of maple trees planted today, we need to subtract 53 from both sides of the equation:\n\n64 - 53 = 53 + Number of maple trees planted today - 53\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n11 = Number of maple trees planted today\n\nTherefore, the workers planted 11 maple trees today.\n\n\n",

Park workers will plant 104 more walnut trees today. How many walnut trees will the park have when the workers are finished ?\n\nTo find the total number of walnut trees in the park, we need to add the number of trees that are already there and the number of trees that are planted today. This is an example of an addition problem, where we add two or more numbers to get a sum.\n\nWe can use the symbol + to represent addition. For example, we can write:\n\n107 + 104 = 211\n\nThis means that if we add 107 and 104, we get 211. We can also use a number line to show addition. A number line is a line that has numbers marked on it, and we can use it to count or add numbers by moving along the line. For example, we can start at 107 on the number line, and then move 104 units to the right. The number where we end up is 211.\n\nWe can also use a place value chart to show addition. A place value chart is a table that shows the value of each digit in a number, depending on its position. For example, in the number",

For example, if we add 3 and 4, we get 7. We can write this as 3 + 4 = 7. The numbers that are added are called addends, and the result is called the sum.\n\nSubtopic 2: How to add whole numbers?\n\nTo add whole numbers, we can use different methods, such as:\n\n- Counting on: We start with the larger number and count up by the smaller number. For example, to add 5 and 3, we can start with 5 and count up 3 more: 5, 6, 7. The sum is 7.\n- Using a number line: We can use a line with numbers marked on it to show the addition. We start with the first addend and move to the right by the second addend. The number where we end up is the sum. For example, to add 5 and",

How many Pokemon cards do they have in all ?\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to add up a large number of Pokemon cards. This skill will come in handy when you want to know how many cards you have in total. Let's get started!\n\nStep 1: Write down the numbers\nFirst, we need to write down the numbers that we want to add. In this case, we have 4 people and each person has 9 dozen Pokemon cards. We can write this as 4 x 9.\n\nStep 2: Multiply the numbers\nNext, we need to multiply the numbers. To do this, we can use a calculator or do it by hand. 4 x 9 is equal to 36.\n\nStep 3: Add the numbers\nNow, we need to add the numbers we got from multiplying. In this case, we have 4 people and each person has 36 Pokemon cards. So, we can add 4 + 36 to get the total number of Pokemon cards.\n\nStep 4: Check your answer\nTo make sure our answer is correct, we can use a different method. We can add the numbers in a different order, like 36 + 4. This should also give us the same answer of 40.\n\nStep 5: Write your answer\nFinally,",

How much will each person get if they share the cupcakes equally?\n\nSolution: To find out how much each person will get, we need to divide the total number of cupcakes by the number of children.
