So we can plug these values into the equation and solve for the unknown variable:\n\n89 - Deleted apps = 24\n\nTo isolate the deleted apps, we need to subtract 89 from both sides of the equation:\n\n89 - 89 - Deleted apps = 24 - 89\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-Deleted apps = -65\n\nTo find the deleted apps, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -1:\n\n-Deleted apps x -1 = -65 x -1\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nDeleted apps = 65\n\nTherefore, Dave deleted 65 apps. To find out how many more apps he added than he deleted, we need to subtract the deleted apps from the added apps:\n\nAdded apps - Deleted apps = 65 - 89\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-24 = -24\n\nThis means that Dave added the same number of apps as he deleted.

To find the total number of balloons, we need to add the number of balloons that Allan and Jake had. We can use the commutative property of addition to rearrange the order of the numbers.

We need to subtract the number of balls that Jake had from the total number of toys. We can write:\n\nTotal number of toys - Jake's balls = Number of balloons\n\nThen, we can substitute the values we found:\n\n87 - 59 = 28\n\nTherefore, Allan and Jake had 28 balloons in the park.\n\n\n",

We can use the following steps:\n\n- First, we need to find the total number of cookies Paco had at the beginning. To do this, we add the number of sweet cookies and the number of salty cookies. We get 9 + 6 = 15.\n- Next, we need to find the total number of cookies Paco ate. To do this, we add the number of sweet cookies he ate and the number of salty cookies he ate. We get 36 + 3 = 39.\n- Then, we need to find the number of cookies Paco had left. To do this, we subtract the total number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he had at the beginning. We get 15 - 39 = -24.\n- Finally, we need to find the number of salty cookies Paco had left. To do this, we subtract the number of cookies he had left from the number of salty cookies he had at the beginning. We get 6 - (-24) = 30.\n\nTherefore, Paco had 30 salty cookies left.\n\n\n",

We can simplify this equation by subtracting 36S from both sides and subtracting 3L from both sides. This gives us -27S + 3L = 0. We can then divide both sides by -3 to get S - L = 0. This means that Paco had the same number of sweet and salty cookies left, which is 3.\n",

How many boys does she give the marbles to?\n\nSolution: To find the number of boys, we need to divide the total number of marbles by the number of marbles given to each boy. This is called a division problem. We can use the symbol \u00f7 or / to show division. For example, 10 \u00f7 5 means the same as 10 / 5.\n\nWe can write the division problem as:\n\n10 \u00f7 5 = ?\n\nTo solve the problem, we can use repeated subtraction or skip counting. Repeated subtraction means we subtract the same number from the total until we reach zero or a number less than the number we are dividing by. Skip counting means we count by the number we are dividing by until we reach the total.\n\nUsing repeated subtraction, we can subtract 5 from 10 four times:\n\n10 - 5 = 5\n5 - 5 = 0\n\nUsing skip counting, we can count by 5 four times:\n\n5, 10, 15, 20\n\nWe can see that both methods give us the same answer: 4. So, Haley gave the marbles to 4 boys.\n",

We can do this by adding the number of cookies he had and the number of cookies he gave to his friend. This gives us 17 + 13 = 30 cookies.\n- Next, we need to find the total number of cookies Paco had after he ate some of them. We can do this by subtracting the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he had before. This gives us 30 - 14 = 16 cookies.\n- Finally, we need to find the difference between the number of cookies Paco ate and the number of cookies he gave to his friend. We can do this by subtracting the number of cookies he gave to his friend from the number of cookies he ate. This gives us 14 - 13 = 1 cookie.\n\nTherefore, Paco ate 3 more cookies than those he gave to his friend.",

We can use the following steps:\n\n- First, we need to find the number of visitors on the previous day. We are given that there were 600 visitors the previous day.\n- Next, we need to find the number of visitors on the current day. We are given that there were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace and 661 visitors that day. We can use the following formula to find the number of visitors per painting: visitors per painting = total visitors / total paintings. Plugging in the given values, we get visitors per painting = 661 / 39 = 16.8. This means that on average, each painting had 16.8 visitors.\n- Now, we can find the number of visitors on the current day by multiplying the number of paintings by the visitors per painting. We get visitors on current day = 39 x 16.8 = 661.2. This means that there were 661.2 visitors on the current day.\n- Finally, we can find the difference between the number of visitors on the two days by subtracting the smaller number from the larger number. We get difference = visitors on current day - visitors on previous day = 661.2 - 600 = 61.2.

            "reasoning_text": "\n\nSolution 0:\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the concept of addition and subtraction. Addition is the operation of combining two or more numbers to get a larger number, and subtraction is the operation of taking away one number from another to get a smaller number.\n\nWe can use a number line to help us visualize the addition and subtraction of numbers. A number line is a horizontal line that has numbers marked at equal intervals. The numbers increase from left to right, and the distance between any two consecutive numbers is the same.\n\nFor example, the number line below shows the numbers from 0 to 10, with a distance of 1 between each number.\n\n0-----1-----2-----3-----4-----5-----6-----7-----8-----9-----10\n\nWe can use the number line to add or subtract numbers by moving left or right along the line. For example, to add 3 to 5, we start at 5 and move 3 units to the right, and we end up at 8. To subtract 3 from 5, we start at 5 and move 3 units to the left, and we end up at 2.\n\nWe can also use the number line to find the sum or difference of two numbers by counting the units between them. For example, to find the sum of 3 and 5, we count 3 units to the right from 0, and then 5 units to the right from 3, and we get 8.",

In this case, the larger number is the number of books, which is 9, and the smaller number is the number of action figures, which is 5. So, we have:\n\n9 - 5 = 4\n\nThis means that there are 4 more books than action figures on the shelf. However, the question asks for the difference between the number of books and action figures, not the number of books minus the number of action figures. To get the difference, we need to add the number of action figures to the result of the subtraction. So, we have:\n\n4 + 5 = 9\n\nThis means that there are 9 more books than action figures on the shelf. Therefore, the answer is B. 8.\n\n\n",

Since each bag has an equal number of candies, the total number of candies is x * number of candies in each bag. So, we can write the equation as x * number of candies in each bag = 86. Since each bag has an equal number of cookies and candies, we can equate the two equations: x * number of cookies in each bag = x * number of candies in each bag. Simplifying the equation, we get number of cookies in each bag = number of candies in each bag.

So, we can write:\n\nNumber of cookies in each bag = Number of bags x Number of cookies in each bag\n\nSubstituting this into the formula, we get:\n\nNumber of bags = 28 / (Number of bags x Number of cookies in each bag)\n\nTo simplify this, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by the number of bags, which is 14. This gives us:\n\nNumber of bags = 28 / (14 x Number of cookies in each bag)\n\nNow, we can cancel out the common factor of 14 from both the numerator and the denominator. This gives us:\n\nNumber of bags = 2 / (Number of cookies in each bag)\n\nFinally, we can plug in the given value of the total number of candies, which is 86, and solve for the number of bags of cookies. We get:\n\nNumber of bags = 2 / (Number of cookies in each bag)\nNumber of bags = 2 / (86 / 14)",

We can assume that the number of candies is equal to the number of cookies in each bag, since the question does not specify otherwise. Therefore, we can write:\n\nNumber of bags = 28 / (28 + 86)\n\nTo simplify this expression, we can factor out 28 from the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumber of bags = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (28 + 86) = 28 / (",

The total number of bird families living near the mountain is 18. The number of bird families that flew away to africa is 38 and the number of bird families that flew away to asia is 80. Therefore, the number of bird families that flew away for the winter is 18 - 38 - 80 = -100. However, this is not a valid answer, because we cannot have a negative number of bird families. This means that we made a mistake in our calculation. The mistake was that we subtracted the wrong numbers. We should have subtracted the number of bird families that flew away to africa from the total number of bird families living near the mountain, and then subtracted the number of bird families that flew away to asia from the result.

The other basket has the same number of red and green peaches. If there are 12 peaches in total, how many green peaches are in each basket?\n\nSolution: Let x be the number of green peaches in each basket. Then, the total number of peaches in each basket is 4 + x. Since there are two baskets, the total number of peaches is 2(4 + x). We are given that the total number of peaches is 12, so we can write an equation:\n\n2(4 + x) = 12\n\nTo solve for x, we can simplify and isolate x:\n\n8 + 2x = 12\n2x = 12 - 8\n2x = 4\nx = 4 / 2\nx = 2\n\nTherefore, there are 2 green peaches in each basket.\n\n\n",

We can use the distributive property of multiplication to simplify the calculation.\n\nThe number of chairs in each set is 14, so we can write it as 14 x 1, where 1 is the number of sets.\n\nThe number of extra chairs is 6, so we can write it as 6 x 1, where 1 is the number of extra chairs.\n\nUsing the distributive property, we can multiply 14 x 1 by 1 and 6 x 1 by 1, and then add the results.\n\n14 x 1 x 1 + 6 x 1 x 1 = 14 + 6 = 20\n\nTherefore, they have 20 chairs for the guests.\n\n\n",

We can use the commutative property of addition to rearrange the order of the numbers, but we need to be careful not to change the total. We can write the problem as:\n\n3 birds + 4 storks + 6 storks = ?\n\nWe can add the birds and storks first, and then add the storks to the result. We can write:\n\n3 birds + 4 storks = 7 birds and storks\n7 birds and storks + 6 storks = 13 birds and storks\n\nTherefore, there are 13 birds and storks sitting on the fence.\n\nSubtopic 2: How to use the commutative property of addition to check our answers?\n\nSometimes, we may need to check our answers to see if they are correct or not. One way to do this is to use the commutative property of addition. The commutative property of addition states that the order of the numbers does not affect the sum. This means that we can swap the order of the numbers and still get the same answer. For example, 3 + 4 = 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nWe can use the commutative property of addition to check our answers",

We can plug these values into the formula and simplify:\n\nNumber of bird families that flew away = 45 - 86\nNumber of bird families that flew away = -41\n\nThe negative sign means that there were more bird families that stayed behind than those that flew away.

How many bottles had she bought?\nA: To find the number of bottles that Debby bought, we need to multiply the number of bottles she drank per day by the number of days the bottles lasted. This is because the bottles lasted for 74 days, and Debby drank 109 bottles a day. So, we can write:\n\nNumber of bottles = 109 x 74\n\nTo multiply these numbers, we can use the distributive property, which says that a(b + c) = ab + ac. So, we can write:\n\nNumber of bottles = (100 + 9) x 74\n\nThen, we can multiply each term inside the parentheses by 74, and add the results. This is called the partial products method. So, we can write:\n\nNumber of bottles = 100 x 74 + 9 x 74\n\nNumber of bottles = 7400 + 666\n\nNumber of bottles = 8266\n\nTherefore, Debby bought 8266 bottles of water.\n",

We can use the following steps:\n\n- First, we add the number of birds and the number of storks that were already sitting on the fence. This gives us the total number of birds and storks on the fence.\n- Next, we add the number of birds that came to join them. This gives us the new total number of birds and storks on the fence.\n- Finally, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks. This gives us the difference between the number of storks and birds on the fence.\n\nUsing these steps, we can solve the problem as follows:\n\n- The number of birds and storks on the fence was 6 + 2 = 8.\n- The new total number of birds and storks on the fence was 8 + 3 = 11.\n- The difference between the number of storks and birds on the fence was 11 - 3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, there were 8 more storks than birds on the fence.\n",

Unitary method is a technique of finding the value of a single unit from the given value of a multiple unit, and then finding the value of any number of units by multiplying the value of a single unit.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the number of sacks of unripe oranges and ripe oranges harvested per day, and we need to find the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested after 73 days.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day. We can do this by dividing the number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day by the ratio of ripe oranges to unripe oranges. The ratio of ripe oranges to unripe oranges is 5:25, which means that for every 5 sacks of ripe oranges, there are 25 sacks of unripe oranges. So, the ratio of ripe oranges to the total number of oranges is 5:(5+25) = 5:30. This means that for every 30 sacks of oranges, there are 5 sacks of ripe oranges.\n\nNow, we can use the unitary method to find the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day.

Similarly, the total revenue from selling jerseys is $34, so we can write the equation: 19y = 34. To find the difference in cost between a t-shirt and a jersey, we need to subtract the cost of a jersey from the cost of a t-shirt. Therefore, the difference is x - y. To solve for x and y, we can divide both sides of each equation by the number of items sold. For the t-shirt equation, we divide both sides by 157: x = 192/157. For the jersey equation, we divide both sides by 19: y = 34/19. Now we can find the difference in cost by subtracting y from x: x - y = (192/157) - (34/19). To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 157 and 19 is 1237. So, we can rewrite the equation as: x - y = (192/157) * (19/19) - (34/19) * (157/157).

If the school decides to add all the suggested foods to the menu, how many different combinations of food can they make?\nA: There are a total of 695 students who suggested adding food to the menu. If we assume that each student can only suggest one type of food, then there are 695 different combinations of food that can be added to the menu.\n\n2. If the school decides to add all the suggested foods to the menu, but they can only choose a maximum of 3 types of food, how many different combinations of food can they make?\nA: If the school can only choose a maximum of 3 types of food, then we need to find the combinations of 3 out of 695. This can be calculated using the combination formula, nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be chosen. Therefore, the number of combinations is 695C3 = 695! / (3!(695-3)!) = 695! / (3!692!) = (695 x 694 x 693) / (3 x 2 x 1",

We can plug these values into the formula and simplify:\n\nNumber of visitors before the previous day = 419 - 103\nNumber of visitors before the previous day = 316\n\nTherefore, 316 visitors came to the Buckingham palace before the previous day.\n\n\n",

How many more sacks of ripe oranges than unripe oranges are harvested per day?\n\nSolution: To find the difference between the number of sacks of ripe and unripe oranges, we need to subtract the smaller number from the larger number. We can use the following steps:\n\n- Step 1: Identify the numbers given in the problem. We have 44 and 25.\n- Step 2: Compare the numbers and find the larger one. 44 is larger than 25, so we use 44 as the first number.\n- Step 3: Compare the numbers and find the smaller one. 25 is smaller than 44, so we use 25 as the second number.\n- Step 4: Subtract the smaller number from the larger number. 44 - 25 = 19.\n- Step 5: Write the answer with the correct sign. The difference between the number of sacks of ripe and unripe oranges is 19. We can write this as 44 - 25 = 19 or 19 more sacks of ripe oranges than unripe oranges.\n",

Then, we can write an equation to represent the given information:\n\nx - 68 = 12\n\nThis equation means that the number of children on the bus after some got off is equal to 12 less than the number of children on the bus before some got off.

This is given as 12.\n\nSo, we can write an equation as follows:\n\n(68 - x) + x = 12\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n68 = 12 + x\n\nSubtracting 12 from both sides, we get:\n\n56 = x\n\nTherefore, the number of children who got on the bus is 56.\n\nTo find the number of children who got off the bus, we need to subtract 56 from 68.\n\n68 - 56 = 12\n\nTherefore, the number of children who got off the bus is 12.\n\nTo find",

Therefore, the total number of meals served in a week is 500 x 7 = 3500 meals. Since each meal consists of a main dish, a side dish, and a dessert, the total number of main dishes served in a week is 3500 x 1 = 3500 main dishes.\n\nQuestion 2:\nIf the school cafeteria has a budget of $1000 per week for ingredients, and each main dish costs $5, each side dish costs $2, and each dessert costs $1, how many main dishes can be served in a week?\n\nAnswer 2:\nThe total cost of ingredients for each meal is $5 + $2 + $1 = $8. Therefore, the number of meals that can be served in a week is $1000 / $8 = 125 meals.
