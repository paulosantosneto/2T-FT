With the advancement of smartphones and digital cameras, taking pictures has become more accessible and convenient. This has also led to the rise of social media platforms where people can share their pictures with others.\n\nMoreover, the ability to delete pictures has also become a useful feature. It allows people to declutter their photo albums and only keep the pictures that hold special meaning to them. This can also help in organizing and managing large collections of pictures.\n\nNegative Side:\nOn the other hand, the constant use of technology and social media has also led to a decrease in face-to-face interactions and a reliance on virtual connections. This can have a negative impact on social skills and relationships.\n\nAdditionally, the pressure to constantly capture and share pictures can also lead to a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) and a need for validation through",
