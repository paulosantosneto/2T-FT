To find the total number of balloons, we need to add the number of balloons that Allan and Jake had. We can use the commutative property of addition to rearrange the order of the numbers. We can write:\n\nAllan's balloons + Jake's balloons = Jake's balloons + Allan's balloons\n\nThen, we can add the numbers in each pair:\n\n3 + 5 = 8\n20 + 59 = 79\n\nFinally, we can add the results:\n\n8 + 79 = 87\n\nHowever, this is not the final answer, because we are looking for the number of balloons, not the total number of toys. We need to subtract the number of balls that Jake had from the total number of toys. We can write:\n\nTotal number of toys - Jake's balls = Number of balloons\n\nThen, we can substitute the values we found:\n\n87 - 59 = 28\n\nTherefore, Allan and Jake had 28 balloons in the park.\n\n\n",

How many salty cookies did Paco have left?\n\nSolution: To find out how many salty cookies Paco had left, we need to subtract the number of salty cookies he ate from the number of salty cookies he had at the beginning. We can use the following steps:\n\n- First, we need to find the total number of cookies Paco had at the beginning. To do this, we add the number of sweet cookies and the number of salty cookies. We get 9 + 6 = 15.\n- Next, we need to find the total number of cookies Paco ate. To do this, we add the number of sweet cookies he ate and the number of salty cookies he ate. We get 36 + 3 = 39.\n- Then, we need to find the number of cookies Paco had left. To do this, we subtract the total number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he had at the beginning. We get 15 - 39 = -24.\n- Finally, we need to find the number of salty cookies Paco had left. To do this, we subtract the number of cookies he had left from the number of salty cookies he had at the beginning. We get 6 - (-24) = 30.\n\nTherefore, Paco had 30 salty cookies left.\n\n\n",

We can simplify this equation by subtracting 36S from both sides and subtracting 3L from both sides. This gives us -27S + 3L = 0. We can then divide both sides by -3 to get S - L = 0. This means that Paco had the same number of sweet and salty cookies left, which is 3.\n",

This means that there is an error in the problem or the solution. One possible error is that Paco ate more cookies than he had, or that he ate some cookies that were not sweet or salty. Another possible error is that the problem did not specify how many cookies Paco had in the first place, or how many cookies he ate in total.\n\nTherefore, we cannot determine how many salty cookies Paco had left with the given information.\n",

How many boys does she give the marbles to?\n\nSolution: To find the number of boys, we need to divide the total number of marbles by the number of marbles given to each boy. This is called a division problem. We can use the symbol \u00f7 or / to show division. For example, 10 \u00f7 5 means the same as 10 / 5.\n\nWe can write the division problem as:\n\n10 \u00f7 5 = ?\n\nTo solve the problem, we can use repeated subtraction or skip counting. Repeated subtraction means we subtract the same number from the total until we reach zero or a number less than the number we are dividing by. Skip counting means we count by the number we are dividing by until we reach the total.\n\nUsing repeated subtraction, we can subtract 5 from 10 four times:\n\n10 - 5 = 5\n5 - 5 = 0\n\nUsing skip counting, we can count by 5 four times:\n\n5, 10, 15, 20\n\nWe can see that both methods give us the same answer: 4. So, Haley gave the marbles to 4 boys.\n",

We can do this by adding the number of cookies he had and the number of cookies he gave to his friend. This gives us 17 + 13 = 30 cookies.\n- Next, we need to find the total number of cookies Paco had after he ate some of them. We can do this by subtracting the number of cookies he ate from the total number of cookies he had before. This gives us 30 - 14 = 16 cookies.\n- Finally, we need to find the difference between the number of cookies Paco ate and the number of cookies he gave to his friend. We can do this by subtracting the number of cookies he gave to his friend from the number of cookies he ate.

We are given that there were 600 visitors the previous day.\n- Next, we need to find the number of visitors on the current day. We are given that there were 39 paintings in the Buckingham palace and 661 visitors that day. We can use the following formula to find the number of visitors per painting: visitors per painting = total visitors / total paintings. Plugging in the given values, we get visitors per painting = 661 / 39 = 16.8. This means that on average, each painting had 16.8 visitors.\n- Now, we can find the number of visitors on the current day by multiplying the number of paintings by the visitors per painting. We get visitors on current day = 39 x 16.8 = 661.2. This means that there were 661.2 visitors on the current day.\n- Finally, we can find the difference between the number of visitors on the two days by subtracting the smaller number from the larger number. We get difference = visitors on current day - visitors on previous day = 661.2 - 600 = 61.2.

They decided to visit the Buckingham palace, where they saw 39 paintings. That day, 661 people came to the palace, while 600 people came the day before. How many more people came to the palace on that day than on the previous day?\n\nSolution: To find the difference between the number of visitors on two days, we can subtract the smaller number from the larger number. In this case, the larger number is 661 and the smaller number is 600. So, we can write:\n\n661 - 600 = 61\n\nTherefore, 61 more people came to the palace on that day than on the previous day.\n\n\n",

Addition is the operation of combining two or more numbers to get a larger number, and subtraction is the operation of taking away one number from another to get a smaller number.\n\nWe can use a number line to help us visualize the addition and subtraction of numbers. A number line is a horizontal line that has numbers marked at equal intervals. The numbers increase from left to right, and the distance between any two consecutive numbers is the same.\n\nFor example, the number line below shows the numbers from 0 to 10, with a distance of 1 between each number.\n\n0-----1-----2-----3-----4-----5-----6-----7-----8-----9-----10\n\nWe can use the number line to add or subtract numbers by moving left or right along the line. For example, to add 3 to 5, we start at 5 and move 3 units to the right, and we end up at 8. To subtract 3 from 5, we start at 5 and move 3 units to the left, and we end up at 2.\n\nWe can also use the number line to find the sum or difference of two numbers by counting the units between them. For example, to find the sum of 3 and 5, we count 3 units to the right from 0, and then 5 units to the right from 3, and we get 8.",

For example, we can mark 43 on the number line and use an arrow to show that we are counting backwards.

This is a subtraction problem that involves finding the difference between two numbers.

If the digit in the lower number is larger than the digit in the upper number, we need to borrow 1 from the next column to the left and add 10 to the upper number.\n- Write the difference below the line, with the same number of digits as the numbers being subtracted.\n- If there is a difference in the leftmost column, write it as the answer.\n\nFor example, to find the number of crayons Paul got for his birthday, we can write:\n\n  177\n- 551\n-----\n\nWe start by subtracting the digits in the ones column, which are 7 and 1. Since 7 is larger than 1, we need to borrow 1 from the tens column and add 10 to the ones column. This gives us 17 - 1 = 16. We write 16 below the line, with one digit",

We can use the distributive property of multiplication to simplify the calculation.\n\nThe number of chairs in each set is 14, so we can write it as 14 x 1, where 1 is the number of sets.\n\nThe number of extra chairs is 6, so we can write it as 6 x 1, where 1 is the number of extra chairs.\n\nUsing the distributive property, we can multiply 14 x 1 by 1 and 6 x 1 by 1, and then add the results.\n\n14 x 1 x 1 + 6 x 1 x 1 = 14 + 6 = 20\n\nTherefore, they have 20 chairs for the guests.\n\n\n",

We can use the commutative property of addition to rearrange the order of the numbers, but we need to be careful not to change the total. We can write the problem as:\n\n3 birds + 4 storks + 6 storks = ?\n\nWe can add the birds and storks first, and then add the storks to the result. We can write:\n\n3 birds + 4 storks = 7 birds and storks\n7 birds and storks + 6 storks = 13 birds and storks\n\nTherefore, there are 13 birds and storks sitting on the fence.\n\nSubtopic 2: How to use the commutative property of addition to check our answers?\n\nSometimes, we may need to check our answers to see if they are correct or not. One way to do this is to use the commutative property of addition. The commutative property of addition states that the order of the numbers does not affect the sum. This means that we can swap the order of the numbers and still get the same answer. For example, 3 + 4 = 4 + 3 = 7.\n\nWe can use the commutative property of addition to check our answers",

However, the question asks for the number of cookies he had left, not the total number of cookies. So we need to subtract the number of cookies he ate from the number of cookies he had left:\n\nNumber of cookies left = 75 - 2\nNumber of cookies left = 73\n\nTherefore, Paco had 73 cookies left.\n\n\n",

How many bottles had she bought?\nA: To find the number of bottles that Debby bought, we need to multiply the number of bottles she drank per day by the number of days the bottles lasted. This is because the bottles lasted for 74 days, and Debby drank 109 bottles a day. So, we can write:\n\nNumber of bottles = 109 x 74\n\nTo multiply these numbers, we can use the distributive property, which says that a(b + c) = ab + ac. So, we can write:\n\nNumber of bottles = (100 + 9) x 74\n\nThen, we can multiply each term inside the parentheses by 74, and add the results. This is called the partial products method. So, we can write:\n\nNumber of bottles = 100 x 74 + 9 x 74\n\nNumber of bottles = 7400 + 666\n\nNumber of bottles = 8266\n\nTherefore, Debby bought 8266 bottles of water.\n",

We can use the following steps:\n\n- First, we add the number of birds and the number of storks that were already sitting on the fence. This gives us the total number of birds and storks on the fence.\n- Next, we add the number of birds that came to join them. This gives us the new total number of birds and storks on the fence.\n- Finally, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks. This gives us the difference between the number of storks and birds on the fence.\n\nUsing these steps, we can solve the problem as follows:\n\n- The number of birds and storks on the fence was 6 + 2 = 8.\n- The new total number of birds and storks on the fence was 8 + 3 = 11.\n- The difference between the number of storks and birds on the fence was 11 - 3 = 8.\n\nTherefore, there were 8 more storks than birds on the fence.\n",

Unitary method is a technique of finding the value of a single unit from the given value of a multiple unit, and then finding the value of any number of units by multiplying the value of a single unit.\n\nIn this problem, we are given the number of sacks of unripe oranges and ripe oranges harvested per day, and we need to find the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested after 73 days.\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day. We can do this by dividing the number of sacks of unripe oranges harvested per day by the ratio of ripe oranges to unripe oranges. The ratio of ripe oranges to unripe oranges is 5:25, which means that for every 5 sacks of ripe oranges, there are 25 sacks of unripe oranges. So, the ratio of ripe oranges to the total number of oranges is 5:(5+25) = 5:30. This means that for every 30 sacks of oranges, there are 5 sacks of ripe oranges.\n\nNow, we can use the unitary method to find the number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day.

Similarly, the total revenue from selling jerseys is $34, so we can write the equation: 19y = 34. To find the difference in cost between a t-shirt and a jersey, we need to subtract the cost of a jersey from the cost of a t-shirt. Therefore, the difference is x - y. To solve for x and y, we can divide both sides of each equation by the number of items sold. For the t-shirt equation, we divide both sides by 157: x = 192/157. For the jersey equation, we divide both sides by 19: y = 34/19. Now we can find the difference in cost by subtracting y from x: x - y = (192/157) - (34/19). To subtract fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 157 and 19 is 1237. So, we can rewrite the equation as: x - y = (192/157) * (19/19) - (34/19) * (157/157).

If the school decides to add all the suggested foods to the menu, how many different combinations of food can they make?\nA: There are a total of 695 students who suggested adding food to the menu. If we assume that each student can only suggest one type of food, then there are 695 different combinations of food that can be added to the menu.\n\n2. If the school decides to add all the suggested foods to the menu, but they can only choose a maximum of 3 types of food, how many different combinations of food can they make?\nA: If the school can only choose a maximum of 3 types of food, then we need to find the combinations of 3 out of 695. This can be calculated using the combination formula, nCr = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be chosen. Therefore, the number of combinations is 695C3 = 695! / (3!(695-3)!) = 695! / (3!692!) = (695 x 694 x 693) / (3 x 2 x 1",

Another possible error is that we assumed that Jessica threw away all the roses in the vase, but we do not know if there were any roses left in the vase before she threw some away.\n\nTo avoid these errors, we need to have more information about the situation.

We can do this by subtracting 60 from both sides of the equation:\n\nNumber of bird families that stayed behind + 60 - 60 = 89 - 60\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nNumber of bird families that stayed behind = 29\n\nNow, we can plug this value into the original equation to find the number of bird families that flew away for the winter:\n\nNumber of bird families that flew away for the winter + 29 = 89\n\nTo solve for the number of bird families that flew away for the winter, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.

We can think of the number of children on the bus as a variable, let us call it x. Then, we can write an equation to represent the given information:\n\nx - 68 = 12\n\nThis equation means that the number of children on the bus after some got off is equal to 12 less than the number of children on the bus before some got off. To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.

To find the number of children that got off the bus, we need to subtract 12 from 80:\n\n80 - 12 = 68\n\nThis means that 68 children got off the bus. To find the difference between the number of children that got off and the number of children that got on, we need to subtract 68 from the number of children that got on:\n\n68 - 68 = 0\n\nThis means that no more children got off the bus than those that got on.
