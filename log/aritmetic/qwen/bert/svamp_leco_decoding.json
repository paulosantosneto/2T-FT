Then the number of marbles Ed had is x + 10. The difference between the two is 45 - x. We know that Doug lost 11 marbles, so x - 11 = 45 - x. Solving this equation gives x = 56. Therefore, the difference between the number of marbles Ed had and the number of marbles Doug had is 45 - 56 = -11. However, this doesn't make sense, as the difference should be positive. Let's re-examine the equation. We know that Doug lost 11 marbles, so x - 11 = 45 - x. Adding x to both sides gives 2x - 11 = 45. Adding 11 to both sides gives 2x = 56. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 28. Therefore, Doug had 28 marbles. The difference between the number of marbles Ed had and the number of marbles Doug had is 45 - 28 = 17.",

The number of athletes that stayed in the camp is 300 - 112 = 188 athletes. The total number of athletes in the camp over the two nights is 188 + 105 = 293 athletes.

It seems there might be a mistake in the information provided. If Bobby ate 5 more pieces after eating x pieces, then he would have eaten x + 5 pieces in total, not x - 5 pieces. Let's correct this and solve the problem again.\n\nIf Bobby ate x pieces and then ate 5 more, he would have eaten x + 5 pieces in total. If he has 8 pieces left, then the total number of pieces he had at the start minus the pieces he ate equals the pieces he has left:\n\nx - (x + 5) = 8\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\nx - x - 5 = 8\n\n-5 = 8\n\nThis equation is still not possible because -5 does not equal",

How much will you pay if you buy two tubs of ice cream and 10 cans of juice? [Answer]The tub of ice cream costs $12 - $2 = $10. So, two tubs of ice cream cost $10 x 2 = $20. The juice is sold at $2 for 5 cans, so it is sold at $2 / 5 = $0.40 per can. So, 10 cans of juice will cost $0.40 x 10 = $4. Therefore, you will pay $20 + $4 = $24. The answer is 24. ",

Question: A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)? Answer: The first apartment costs $800 + ($260 * 31) = $11,760 per month. The second apartment costs $900 + ($200 * 21)",

The answer is 3834. Question: A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)? Answer: The first apartment costs $800 + ($260 * 31) = $8",

[Answer]The number of athletes that left the camp is 4 * 28 = 112. The number of athletes that trickled into the camp is 7 * 15 = 105. The number of athletes that stayed in the camp is 300 - 112 + 105 = 287. The difference in the total number of athletes over the two nights is 300 - 287 = 13. The answer is 13. ",
