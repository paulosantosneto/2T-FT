This means that the number of bikinis is $0.375T$ and the number of trunks is $0.25T$.\n\nThe total number of garments is the sum of the number of bikinis and the number of trunks, so we have:\n\n$0.375T + 0.25T = T$\n\nTo solve for $T$, we can combine the terms on the left side:\n\n$0.625T = T$\n\nSubtracting $0.625T$ from both sides gives us:\n\n$0 = 0.375T - 0.625T$\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n$0 = -0.25T$\n\nSince we cannot have a negative number of garments, this means that the total number of garments $T$ must be zero.
