The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)? Answer: The first apartment costs $800 + ($260 * 31) = $800 + $8060 = $8860 per month. The second apartment costs $900 + ($200 * 21) = $900 + $42",

Question: A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments. The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)? Answer: The first apartment costs $800 + ($260 * 31) = $800 + $8060 = $8860 per month. The second apartment costs $900 + ($200 * 21)",

How much will you pay if you buy two tubs of ice cream and 10 cans of juice? [Answer]The tub of ice cream costs $12 - $2 = $10. So, two tubs of ice cream cost $10 x 2 = $20. The juice is sold at $2 for 5 cans, so it is sold at $2 / 5 = $0.40 per can. So, 10 cans of juice cost $0.40 x 10 = $4. Therefore, you will pay $20 + $4 = $24. The answer is 24",

Over the next 7 hours, a new group of athletes trickled into the camp at a rate of 15 athletes per hour. Immediately thereafter, the camp gate was shut and everyone went to bed. What is the difference in the total number of athletes in the camp over the two nights? [Answer]The number of athletes that left the camp is 4 * 28 = 112. The number of athletes that trickled into the camp is 7 * 15 = 105. The number of athletes that stayed in the camp is 300 - 112 + 105 = 287. The difference in the total number of athletes over the two nights is 300 - 287 = 13. The answer is 13. ",

The first apartment costs $800 per month in rent and will cost an additional $260 per month in utilities. The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work. The second apartment is closer, and the man would only have to drive 21 miles to get to work. According to the IRS, each mile a person drives has an average cost of 58 cents. If the man must drive to work 20 days each month, what is the difference between the total monthly costs of these two apartments after factoring in utility and driving-related costs (to the nearest whole dollar)? Answer: The first apartment costs $800 + ($260 * 31) = $1,330 per month. The second apartment costs $900 + ($200 * 21) = $1,300 per month. The total monthly cost of the first apartment,",

Question: A man is trying to maximize the amount of money he saves each month. In particular, he is trying to decide between two different apartments.

The second apartment costs $900 per month and will cost an additional $200 per month in utilities. The first apartment is slightly further from the man's work, and the man would have to drive 31 miles per day to get to work.
