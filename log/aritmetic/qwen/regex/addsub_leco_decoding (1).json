A light-year is the distance that light travels in one year. \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to add up the distances traveled by the spaceship from Earth to Planet X, from Planet X to Planet Y, and from Planet Y back to Earth. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance traveled from Earth to Planet X. Since the spaceship traveled 0.5 light-years from Earth to Planet X, we can write this as:\n\nDistance from Earth to Planet X = 0.5 light-years\n\nNext, let's calculate the distance traveled from Planet X to Planet Y. Since the spaceship traveled 0.1 light-years from Planet X to Planet Y, we can write this as:\n\nDistance from Planet X to Planet Y = 0.1 light-years\n\nFinally, let's calculate the distance traveled from Planet Y back to Earth. Since the spaceship traveled 0.1 light-years from Planet Y back to Earth, we can write this as:\n\nDistance from Planet Y to Earth = 0.1 light-years\n\nNow, we can add up these distances to find the total distance traveled by the spaceship:\n\nTotal distance traveled = Distance from Earth to Planet X + Distance from Planet X to Planet Y + Distance from Planet Y to Earth\n\nTotal distance traveled = 0.5 light-years + 0.1 light-years + 0.1 light-years\n\nTotal distance traveled = 0",
